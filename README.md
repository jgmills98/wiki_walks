# Wiki Walks

Wiki Walks is a project that I was curious about after a friend told me about a game he and his friends would play.

The game was essentially how many "clicks" (steps) would it take to get to Hitler while starting at a random page. For most start points, that number is pretty low.

I wanted to make an application that allows the user select any start point they wanted and any end point they wanted to reach. So if the user still wants to play with the original game idea, they can select Hitler to be the end point and start from any point they can think of, or be given an random start point.

Examples of this on Wikipedia can be:

start: Dog
end: Charles Darwin

Dog -> Divergent Evolution -> Darwin's Finches -> Charles Darwin

**found out after finishing the algorithm. The above route is technically:

Dog -> Taxonomy_(biology) -> Charles_Darwin***
